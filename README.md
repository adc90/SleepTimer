Desc: Simple sleep timer program for use in linux


About: Sometimes I like to listen to something on my computer and I thought it would be usefull
if I could cut it off during the night. I'm sure theres probably a more elegant sollution in the
form of a linux command, but I just wanted a project so I could mess with perl a bit.
